This repository contains the project where I contributed to the TensorFlow Team during GSoC in the year 2022.

## ArcFace Loss
![](https://github.com/aylinaydincs/GSoC-22-Project/blob/main/Photos/architecture.jpg)

>Additive Angular Margin Loss (ArcFace) has a clear geometric interpretation due to the exact correspondence to the geodesic distance on the hypersphere, and consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art and can be easily implemented with negligible computational overhead.


### Standalone usage:

<loss_fn = tfsim.losses.ArcFaceLoss(num_classes=2, embedding_size=3)
 labels = tf.Variable([1, 0])
 embeddings = tf.Variable([[0.2, 0.3, 0.1], [0.4, 0.5, 0.5]])
 loss = loss_fn(labels, embeddings)>
```javascript
{
    // Editor.md theme, default or dark, change at v1.5.0
    // You can also custom css class .editormd-theme-xxxx
    theme : "default | dark",

    // Preview container theme, added v1.5.0
    // You can also custom css class .editormd-preview-theme-xxxx
    previewTheme : "default | dark",

    // Added @v1.5.0 & after version this is CodeMirror (editor area) theme
    editorTheme : editormd.editorThemes['theme-name']
}
```
