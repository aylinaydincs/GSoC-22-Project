## ArcFace Loss

>Additive Angular Margin Loss (ArcFace) has a clear geometric interpretation due to the exact correspondence to the geodesic distance on the hypersphere, and consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art and can be easily implemented with negligible computational overhead.


### Standalone usage:

>>> loss_fn = tfsim.losses.ArcFaceLoss(num_classes=2, embedding_size=3)
>>> labels = tf.Variable([1, 0])
>>> embeddings = tf.Variable([[0.2, 0.3, 0.1], [0.4, 0.5, 0.5]])
>>> loss = loss_fn(labels, embeddings)
